# Why this tcpserver 
The course tcp was very unstable when a connection was removed or somehow disconnected. Therefore a more stable version is made that can handle disconnections between robot cars.

# How to build
Building is only tested in linux.

``` bash

cd server/
make 
./tcpserver

```
